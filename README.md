**Documentation**

If you want to know what each calculator does, look here.


(1) *Vanilla*

----------

  (1) Cryofluid mixers to impact reactors - Tells you how many impact reactors can be run off of the number of cryofluid mixers you have set up for your impact reactors.
  
  (2) Blast mixers to impact reactors - Tells you how many impact reactors can be run off of the number of blast mixers you have set up for your impact reactors.
  
  (3) Surge production - tells you how many surge smelters you can run based on how much of each item you are producing p/sec, including whether your items are balanced, and how much excess you have.
  
  (4) Cryofluid mixers to thorium reactors - Tells you how many thorium reactors can be run off of the number of cryofluid mixers you have set up for your thorium reactors.
  
  (5) Thorium to thorium reactors - Tells you how many thorium reactors can be run off of how much thorium production you have set up for your thorium reactors.
  
  (6) Airblast drill boost - Tells you how much your airblast drill will produce after it is boosted with water and an overdrive projector.

----------

(2) *Exogenesis*

----------

  (1) Pyratite factories to blast factories - Tells you how many blast factories you can run with the pyratite you are producing from your pyratite factories.

  (2) Blast factories to impact reactors - Tells you how many impact reactors you can run off of the number of blast factories you have set up for your impact reactor.

  (3) Pyratite factories to impact reactors - Combines (1) and (2) by figuring out how many blast factories you can run off of your pyratite factories, and then figuring out how many impact reactors you can run with those blast factories.

  (4) Goliath drill boost - Tells you how much your goliath drill will produce after it is boosted with water and an overdrive projector.

  (5) MPD boost - Tells you how much your MPD will produce after it is boosted with water and an overdrive projector.
